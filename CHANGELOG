BCT 0.3.2

- Change several functions including threshold_proportional and binarize to
    have copy=True as default argument
- Fix bug in threshold_proportional where copying behavior did not work for
    symmetric matrices.
- Fix minor quirk in threshold_proportional where np.round rounds to nearest
    even number (optimizes floating point) which is discrepant with BCT
- Add a test suite with some functions

BCT 0.3.1

- Fix bug in NBS
- Fix series of bugs in null_models

BCT 0.3

- Added NBS
- Added in all of the new functions from the Dec 2013 release of BCT
- Fixed numerous bugs having to do with indexing errors in modularity
- Fixed several odd bugs with clustering_coef, efficiency, distance 

For the next release, I clearly need a real test suite.
